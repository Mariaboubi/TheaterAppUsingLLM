# 🎭 TheaterAppUsingLLM

**TheaterAppUsingLLM** is a demo Android application that simulates how a modern theatre could interact with its audience through a friendly chat-based assistant.
Instead of long menus or complicated navigation, users can simply write in natural language (Greek or English) to the app, just like talking to the box office clerk.

The app was designed as part of a coursework assignment with the goal of combining traditional theatre experiences with the power of conversational AI.

# What it does

-  Get information about the plays running in the theatre.

-  Book or cancel tickets for specific performances.

-  Choose between afternoon and evening shows, in two different halls.

-  Confirm actions before issuing tickets, to avoid mistakes.

-  See your wallet and ticket history in the app.

-  In case of repeated misunderstandings, the system suggests human intervention (a theatre clerk).

# 🌐 Natural language dialogues

The key innovation of this app is the use of an LLM (Large Language Model) to power conversations:

- Users type in Greek or English.

- The assistant understands the request and responds naturally.

- Example interactions:

    - “Give me informations for the theater"

    - “Θέλω να ακυρώσω το εισιτήριο μου”

This makes the app feel closer to a human conversation than a rigid form.

# 🚀 How to try it

1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Open in Android Studio and run on an emulator or device.

3. Start chatting with the assistant to ask about shows and reserve your seat.
